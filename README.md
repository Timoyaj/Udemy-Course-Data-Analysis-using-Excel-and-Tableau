# Udemy-Course-Data-Analysis-using-Excel-and-Tableau

This Project was done during EntryLevel Virtual experience as a Data Analyst. We were provided with data on courses on different topics from the education tech company Udemy. And were asked to present the data on course revenue on courses from different topics to understand where opportunities to increase revenue may lie, and track the performance of courses. We were mandated to present a report to the CEO in the next three weeks on how they will increase their next quarter's earnings.
The data provided were in four separate Google sheets.

We consolidated the four sheets and performed data cleaning using Power Query in Excel. We then loaded the cleaned data into Tableau Desktop to perform data analysis and visualization using the Tableau dashboard to tell our story which is found at https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/yaji.timothy.t
